            <p class = "beat2"contenteditable="true">But no mix of words will ever convey it.</p>

            <p class="swing" contenteditable="true">My central memory</p>
            <p class="beat1" contenteditable="true">...when I left Filmore half-crazy...</p>
            <p class="beat1" contenteditable="true">instead of going home, aimed across the Bay Bridge a hundred miles an hour...</p>

            <p class="beat1" contenteditable="true">...booming through the Treasure Island Tunnel...</p>
            <p class="beat1" contenteditable="true">... not quite sure which turn-off to take...</p>
            <p class="beat1" contenteditable="true">always stalling at the toll-gate...</p>
            <p class="beat2" contenteditable="true">but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was.</p>
            <p class="beat2" contenteditable="true">No doubt at all about that...</p>
            <p class="beat2" contenteditable="true">There was madness in every direction, at any hour.</p>
            <p class="beat2" contenteditable="true">If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate...</p>
            <p class="beat2" contenteditable="true">You could see sparks anywhere.</p>
            <p class="beat3" contenteditable="true">There was a fantastic universal sense . . . that we were winning.</p>
            <p class="admonition" contenteditable="true">Here's the speech clincher...!</p>
            <p class="swing" contenteditable="true">And the wave... breaks...</p>
            <p class="rest1" contenteditable="true">And that, I think was the handle.</p>
            <p class="rest1" contenteditable="true">That sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil.</p>
            <p class="beat2" contenteditable="true">There was no point in fighting.</p>
            <p class="beat1" contenteditable="true">We had all the momentum...</p>

            <p class="rest2" contenteditable="true">So now, less than five years later... with the right kind of eyes, you can almost see the high-water mark... that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.</p>
